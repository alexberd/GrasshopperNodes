## Single Objective Genetic Algorithm within a Python Grasshopper Node

This implementation offers a very similar functionality to the [Grasshopper Galapagos](https://grasshopperdocs.com/addons/galapagos.html)

### Minimize the time waiting for the right results
The difference to Galapagos is that you can manipulate in real time any of the features and you can analyse the results of your optimzation during your optimization run

### Usage
Create a python node and copy-paste the [snippet](https://github.com/alexberd/Grasshopper_PythonSnippets/blob/master/GeneticAlgorithm/SingleObjectiveGeneticAlgorithm.py). Rename and connect it to the other nodes similar to the image below
