The following definitions decompose two or more different Breps to vertices and then compares their vertices one to one in order to find if they are they same. 
Tolerance parameter define the minimun threashold used to consider elements different (when comparing vertexes)

### Compare multiple Brep Elements

### Compare multiple Brep Elements - Ortho Version
This is similar to the previous but also considers elements to be the same when they are rotated 0, 90, 180 and 270 degrees
